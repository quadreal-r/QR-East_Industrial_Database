## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Staged edit mode with a floating Save bar and grouped summary of pending changes
- Incremental Supabase save that applies only entities changed since the last saved baseline

### Changed

- Map, polygon, and notes edits stage locally until Save; Discard reverts to the last-saved state
- Ctrl/Cmd+S saves staged changes instead of showing an auto-save message

### Fixed

- Save no longer re-syncs the entire portfolio (hundreds of RTU/building requests) for a single edit
- Save UI stuck in loading state and repeated network request loops during save
